I wrote a post in sysadmin about a year ago about my MDT script and how they build fresh, shiny golden images for me every week. With the new almost-SP2 release for Windows 7, I thought I'd polish up the script and update my guide. The purpose of this guide is to get you to stop building your golden images by hand. That's dumb, you have better things to do than a) build images by hand and b) wait for those images to get updated at deployment time. At the end of this guide you will have an envir.

Любое несоответствие информации о продукте на сайте с фактом является досадным недоразумением. Brand New DeskMini 310 supports Intel ® 8th Gen Processors. Offering up to 72.6% CPU performance compare to previous generation. Its a 00 budget build and I was wondering if it will run games at 100+ fps (like Overwatch, Fortnite, Rocket League). Not really good with PCs so wondering if this can work for the long run? If this is bad please recommend another build or change of parts. Also dont know how to build so would any PC building tutorial work would there have to be a specific video for this build?

Configure the Intel Lga3647 Workstation to your ideal requirements. Hey all, I have a main gaming/editing PC at home so I don't need a powerhouse laptop, just something I can use to teach the basics of Adobe software on. I'll need HDMI to connect to digital projectors, headphone jack to connect to speaker system, and full SD slot to copy video footage over from cameras. I know I could use a USB hub for this but would rather not. I've done some research and listed a few laptops at the bottom of this post, would you recommend one of these or something else?. I bought a lot of preowned computers in my time and felt pretty intimidated building my own one. I finally saved enough to get a high end PC and pre built is just too expensive. Just going to copy and paste whats from my amazon basket, and just wondering I'm headed in the right direction, and if I should have any problems please don't hesitate to help me :) EVGA 750 GQ, 80+ Gold 750W, Semi Modular, EVGA ECO Mode, 5 Year Warranty, Power Supply 210-GQ-0750-V1 Samsung Howdy folks.

Hi, amp#x200B; I have just started learning ESXi and I have taken upon a mission to create a pfSense virtual firewall. To do so: \- got an old i5 PC with decent configs \- threw in a dual NIC card ( this (https://www.amazon.ca/Ubit-Ethernet-Controller-Interface-Converter/dp/B07KPSV5CS/ref=sr_1_3?crid=8XJ3S5AM9TPSampkeywords=dual+nic+cardampqid=1554788027amps=gatewayampsprefix=dual+nic%2Caps%2C189ampsr=8-3) exactly) \- the NIC turned out to be of realtek - so ended up installing. 
I recently upgraded my Htc vive pro to wireless but the lag on it was horrendous so I upgraded from a msi gtx 960 to a Msi gtx 1070 x 8gb thinking that was the problem, however the vive still lags and I'm not sure what part to try and upgrade now. amp#x200B; My Pc: CPU: Intel Core i5 4690K Processor (3.5 GHz, 6 MB Cache, LGA1150 Socket) Motherboard: MSI H97 Gaming 3 Intel LGA1150 H97 ATX Motherboard (4x DDR3, 6x USB3.0, 6x USB2.0, GBE, LAN, HDMI, DVI, DP, VGA) Memory: HyperX Savage. Hi all, Wanted to ask for your input on choosing the right gear for the gigabit fiber internet which I will be getting soon. I have narrowed down to a few options and wanted to ask for your help. I lived with ISP locked router for the couple of last years, so maybe now I am trying to overcompensate a bit.

Microsoft Windows Ok, so I'm a straight up noob when it comes to computers. I went on YouTube and copied someone's build, later I used it for about 2 weeks and it was running 100% fine. I read that the i7 9700k chip had a overclock mode (I know nothing about overclocking) so I decided to try it. Without knowing anything about it, my mother boards desktop app opens and shows me how far I can over clock when I set it to auto, I think it said 5200.mhz so I was like cool and let the program do it's thing. Hi guys, this is my first laptop which I will use and it will be business use mostly. When I used it in 'default' from the box I noticed freezing after closing an app like Settings or Edge. It was a known problem according to Google but I was still surprised. It would go away if I select nVidia GPU in nVidia settings instead of Auto. I also loved how touchpad worked. Also after reboot then windows logon my fans were blowing for 30-60 seconds. I think it was not related to Dragon Center 
So my son gave me a youtube link to get his computer, but I've 'deviated' in a few places such as the i9 instead of the i7, and changing the motherboard and case and now not being sure if everything will fit etc etc plus stumped on a cooler. How's it look? Plus I don't know what case to get because I'm not sure if everything will fit.
